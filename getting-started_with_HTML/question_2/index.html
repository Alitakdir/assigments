    <p>HTML <!--...--> Tag
        The comment tag is used to insert comments in the source code. Comments are not displayed in the browsers. You can use comments to explain your code, which can help you when you edit the source code at a later date.</p>
        <p>How do you comment in HTML? 
            To leave a comment in HTML, place a <! -- tag before the code and a --> tag after the code that you want to hide.</p>
     <!-- THIS LINE IS IN COMMENT        -->

    <h1>VS CODE</h1>

<P>What is VS Code used for?
     <hr>Visual Studio Code is a streamlined code <br>
      editor with support for development operations like debugging, <br>
       task running, and version control. It aims to provide just  <br>
       the tools a developer needs for a quick code-build-debug <br>
        cycle and leaves more complex workflows to fuller featured IDEs, such as Visual Studio IDE.</P>
